      "\n",
      "\"I think it's fair to say I disliked propping. Back in 2002 the coaches were looking for mobile props so I went in there to get in the squad and stayed there for five years and two World Cups which we won.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't easy, I wasn't playing there at all at any other level and after the last World Cup in 2006 I decided to call a halt to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I had slipped a disk in my neck and was experiencing really bad headaches. I was playing club and for Canterbury at flanker and 8 which I loved and I decided to just myself available again as a backrow player for New Zealand.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Terrible is a good way to put how that went! It was one of those trips where we knew the budget was always going to be very tight but I think we were could have been treated better. We were staying miles out of anywhere and the accommodation and food, things like that, were pretty poor. We played well at the start but we had a small squad and it was tough going so everything accumulated towards the end and it showed in the last test. We didn't play well and we were punished for it.\"\n",

So sometimes being unknown is a benefit. I don't envy the teams who play all the time really though. I like my life, I work fulltime on the farm at Mount Hutt, and I feel a bit more balanced. I don't sleep and breathe rugby, I train with the local men's team and it's like a small community and it's kept rugby exciting for me the last few years.\"\n",

We're finding the breakdown area quite tough - after the first game we felt that we weren't being allowed to clear it out or use our feet and it's frustrating as teams playing us want to slow us down so the game suffers. That's the benefit of moving on to the semis now. As we play better teams hopefully we can clear it out faster and have a bit more competition there. We have a lot of places to improve.\"\n",

We need to stay on top of them and go out there and finish it off. We beat them well in the last World Cup but they were still scrapping till the end. The hard thing with France is that once they know they are beaten it turns into a a scrap so you have to just focus on staying controlled and disciplined.\"\n",

We want to be four time World Champs and we have definitely got the team here to do but but yeah there is pressure on us every game, probably the same pressure there is on England.
